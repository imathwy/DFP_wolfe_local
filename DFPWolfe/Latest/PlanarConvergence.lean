Latest manuscript Theorem 3 (`thm:planar-convergence`). The mathematical statement
and corrected-log proof are unchanged from the completed v21 proof. The source
initial Hessian, neighborhood regularity and complete weak-Wolfe parameter range
are retained. Finite termination is represented by constant continuation.

/-- thm:planar-convergence. In two dimensions, classical DFP under fixed weak
Wolfe conditions converges to the unique minimizer when the Hessian has a positive
global lower bound and is locally Lipschitz near the initial level set. The
conclusion explicitly distinguishes finite stopping and a nonstationary infinite
trajectory. The reused proof uses the source secant coefficient and corrected-log
cancellation with square-summable steps. -/
